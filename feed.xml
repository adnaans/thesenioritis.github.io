         <title><![CDATA[Eric Her and Madison Mosier]]></title>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>My main intent in starting this blog is to share my thoughts, ideas, and stories. After trying out other blogging platforms (with much frustration and inconsistency), such as <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, I finally decided it was time to host my own blog. My primary goal is to create content that&#39;s interesting and to share my thoughts on the world around me. The life of a high school student is more eventful than you may think! I also want to write more and continue to develop and improve my style of writing.</p>
