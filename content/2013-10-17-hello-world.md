My main intent in starting this blog is to share my thoughts, ideas, and stories. After trying out other blogging platforms (with much frustration and inconsistency), such as [Medium](http://medium.com) and [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), I finally decided it was time to host my own blog. My primary goal is to create content that's interesting and to share my thoughts on the world around me. The life of a high school student is more eventful than you may think! I also want to write more and continue to develop and improve my style of writing.
